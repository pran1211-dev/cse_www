At 42 stories, Riverside Towers stands as one of the tallest residential buildings in Long Island City — a bold addition to the Queens waterfront that demanded an equally bold structural approach. CityScape Engineering provided full structural design services from schematic design through construction administration.

The building's structural system employs a hybrid approach combining post-tensioned concrete flat plates for the residential floors with structural steel framing at the ground-level retail and amenity spaces. This combination allowed for the column-free retail spans the architect envisioned while maintaining the efficient floor-to-floor heights required for 380 residential units above.

The foundation system presented its own challenges. Situated adjacent to the East River, the site required extensive dewatering and a secant pile wall system to manage hydrostatic pressures during construction. CityScape's support of excavation design enabled the three levels of below-grade parking without disrupting the neighboring properties.

Wind engineering was a critical consideration at this height and exposure. Working with the project's wind consultant, we optimized the lateral system using a concrete core with outrigger trusses at the mechanical floors, reducing the building's drift to well within code limits while minimizing material usage.

The result is a structure that performs efficiently, builds cleanly, and gives the architect the flexibility they needed to create a landmark residential tower on the Queens waterfront.
