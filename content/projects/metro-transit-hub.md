The Metro Transit Hub rehabilitation required CityScape Engineering to balance the competing demands of structural modernization, historic preservation, and uninterrupted daily operations. The facility serves over 40,000 commuters daily — there was no option to shut down.

Our scope included a comprehensive structural assessment of the existing 1930s-era steel and concrete framing, followed by a phased rehabilitation plan that addressed seismic deficiencies, corroded structural members, and load capacity shortfalls at the platform levels.

The seismic retrofit employed a combination of new steel braced frames and fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) wrapping of existing concrete columns — a technique that allowed us to increase column capacities without the noise and disruption of traditional concrete jacketing.

Platform upgrades required careful coordination with the transit authority's signal and track engineers. New steel framing for ADA-compliant elevators and widened platform edges was designed to be installed during overnight service windows, with each steel piece sized to fit through existing access points.

The project was delivered on schedule with zero service disruptions — exactly as planned.
