This 1890s brownstone in the Brooklyn Heights Historic District had survived over a century of New York weather, but decades of deferred maintenance had taken their toll. The owner sought a complete interior renovation — one that would open up the floor plan for modern living while preserving the building's historic character and landmarked facade.

CityScape's structural investigation revealed several critical conditions: deteriorated bearing walls at the cellar level, a rear wall with significant outward lean, and floor joists with notching and water damage that had reduced their effective capacity. None of these conditions were visible from the interior finishes that concealed them.

Our restoration approach was surgical. We designed a new steel moment frame at the cellar to replace the deteriorated bearing walls, opening up the lower level to the full-width entertaining space the owner envisioned. The leaning rear wall was stabilized with new steel tie-back rods anchored to the party walls, concealed within the new interior construction.

Where floor joists were compromised, we sistered new engineered lumber alongside the originals rather than replacing them — preserving the floor's historic character (including the original slight sag that gives these buildings their lived-in feel) while bringing the structure up to current code capacities.

The project required close coordination with the Landmarks Preservation Commission and the DOB's Special Inspection requirements. CityScape provided both the structural design and the required special inspections, streamlining the approval process.

The restored brownstone now combines the best of its 19th-century bones with a 21st-century structural system — invisible from the street, exactly as it should be.
