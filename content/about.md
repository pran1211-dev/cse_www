## Who We Are

CityScape Engineering is a full-service structural engineering firm headquartered in New York City. We provide structural design, inspection, peer review, and civil engineering services for projects of every scale — from single-family renovations to high-rise towers.

Our team brings decades of combined experience across residential, commercial, industrial, and mixed-use construction. We work closely with architects, contractors, developers, and property owners to deliver structural solutions that are safe, efficient, and built to last.

## Our Approach

Every project starts with a clear understanding of the structural challenges at hand. We listen first, then engineer solutions that balance safety, cost, and constructability.

- **Collaborative** — We integrate seamlessly with your design and construction team
- **Practical** — Our designs prioritize buildability and real-world performance
- **Responsive** — We understand construction timelines and deliver accordingly
- **Licensed** — Our principals hold PE licenses in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut

## Service Area

We serve clients throughout the tri-state area:

- **New York** — All five boroughs, Long Island, Westchester, and Hudson Valley
- **New Jersey** — Northern and Central New Jersey
- **Connecticut** — Fairfield County and the greater Hartford area

## Why Clients Choose CityScape

Our clients return to us because we deliver. We combine deep technical expertise with a practical, contractor-friendly approach. Whether the project is a ground-up tower or a complex renovation of a century-old brownstone, we bring the same level of care and precision.

We are committed to building long-term relationships — not just structures.
