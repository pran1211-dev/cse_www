## Our Approach

Every project starts with a clear understanding of the structural challenges at hand. We listen first, then engineer solutions that balance safety, cost, and constructability.

Our principals hold PE licenses in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. We bring the same level of care and precision to a single-family renovation as we do to a ground-up commercial tower.

## Why Clients Choose CityScape

Our clients return to us because we deliver. We combine deep technical expertise with a practical, contractor-friendly approach. Whether the project is a ground-up tower or a complex renovation of a century-old brownstone, we bring the same level of care and precision.

We are committed to building long-term relationships — not just structures.
