The evolution of steel connection design has been one of the most significant developments in structural engineering over the past decade. Modern high-rise construction in New York City demands connections that are not only stronger but faster to fabricate and erect.

## Bolted vs. Welded Connections

Traditional moment connections relied heavily on field welding — a process that is weather-dependent, labor-intensive, and difficult to inspect. Today's designs increasingly favor bolted connections with extended end plates, reducing field labor and improving quality control.

## What This Means for Your Project

For developers and contractors, these advances translate directly to shorter construction schedules and more predictable costs. At CityScape Engineering, we design steel connections that optimize for both structural performance and constructability.
