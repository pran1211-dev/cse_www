The $35 million Earl Monroe New Renaissance Basketball School in the Bronx showcases an innovative structural solution: three custom trusses, the largest spanning 92 feet and standing 12 feet tall, support three floors of classrooms above a full-size gymnasium.

The design team strategically concealed these massive structural elements within walls and ceilings to maintain the building's open floor plan while meeting the demanding load requirements of stacking occupied floors above a column-free gym space.

This project demonstrates how creative structural engineering can solve complex architectural challenges in educational facilities — delivering both performance and aesthetics without compromise.
