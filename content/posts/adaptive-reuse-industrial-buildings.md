Adaptive reuse of industrial buildings has become one of the most compelling trends in urban development across the tri-state area. Former warehouses, factories, and manufacturing facilities are being transformed into loft apartments, office spaces, restaurants, and mixed-use developments.

## Structural Assessment Is the Starting Point

Before any design work begins, a thorough structural assessment of the existing building is essential. Industrial buildings were designed for specific loading conditions that may differ significantly from the intended new use.

## Floor Load Capacity

Many industrial buildings were designed for heavy equipment and storage loads that exceed typical residential or office requirements. Conversely, some lighter industrial structures may need reinforcement to support new mechanical equipment or rooftop additions.

## Preserving Character While Meeting Code

The appeal of adaptive reuse lies in preserving the character of the original structure — exposed steel, timber trusses, masonry walls. Our approach balances preservation of these elements with modern code compliance, including seismic upgrades and accessibility requirements.

CityScape Engineering has worked on adaptive reuse projects throughout New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, bringing engineering expertise to projects that honor the past while building for the future.
