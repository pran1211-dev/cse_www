The New York City Department of Buildings has implemented several code updates for 2026 that directly impact structural engineering requirements for both new construction and renovation projects.

## Updated Seismic Requirements

New seismic design provisions align with the latest ASCE 7 standards, affecting foundation design and lateral force-resisting systems for buildings in certain risk categories.

## Façade Inspection Changes

Local Law 11 (FISP) inspection cycles and reporting requirements have been updated, with stricter timelines for addressing unsafe conditions.

## Sustainability and Structural Reuse

New provisions encourage adaptive reuse of existing structures, with clearer pathways for engineers to evaluate and certify existing structural systems for new occupancies.

Property owners planning renovations or alterations should consult with a licensed structural engineer early in the process to ensure compliance with the updated code.
