Structural assessments are one of the most common services we provide at CityScape Engineering. Whether you're planning a renovation, purchasing a property, or responding to visible damage, understanding when a professional structural evaluation is needed can save time, money, and potentially prevent serious safety issues.

## Renovation or Alteration Projects

Any renovation that modifies the building's structural system requires a licensed structural engineer. This includes:

- **Removing or modifying bearing walls** — Even partial removals require engineering analysis and a proper beam/header design
- **Adding a floor or story** — Existing foundations and framing must be evaluated for the additional load
- **Changing the building's use** — Converting a residential building to commercial use often means higher code-required loads
- **Opening up floor plans** — Removing columns or walls to create open layouts requires careful load path analysis

In New York City, the Department of Buildings requires structural plans stamped by a licensed PE for most alteration work. Similar requirements apply in New Jersey and Connecticut.

## Property Purchases and Due Diligence

Buyers of older properties — particularly pre-war buildings, brownstones, and industrial conversions — should consider a structural assessment as part of their due diligence. A standard home inspection does not evaluate structural adequacy. Issues like foundation settlement, deteriorated structural members, and inadequate lateral bracing can be expensive to address and are best identified before closing.

## Visible Damage or Concerns

Contact a structural engineer if you observe:

- **Cracks in foundation walls or slabs** — Particularly diagonal cracks or cracks wider than 1/4 inch
- **Sagging floors or roof lines** — May indicate overloaded or deteriorated framing
- **Doors and windows that no longer close properly** — Can signal differential settlement
- **Water damage to structural members** — Especially in basements and crawl spaces
- **Neighboring construction activity** — Excavation, demolition, or pile driving near your property

## After Extreme Weather Events

Hurricanes, flooding, heavy snow loads, and seismic events can all compromise a building's structural integrity in ways that aren't immediately visible. If your building has been through an extreme event, an engineering assessment can identify damage before it progresses.

## What to Expect

A typical structural assessment includes a visual inspection of accessible structural elements, documentation of existing conditions, and a written report with findings and recommendations. Depending on the scope, it may also include material testing, structural calculations, or monitoring over time.

At CityScape Engineering, we provide structural assessments for all building types across the tri-state area. If you're unsure whether your situation requires an engineer, feel free to call us — we're happy to discuss your project and advise on next steps.
