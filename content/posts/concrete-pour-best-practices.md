Concrete placement during the winter months presents unique challenges for construction teams in the tri-state area. Freezing temperatures can compromise concrete strength development, leading to cracking, scaling, and long-term durability issues if proper precautions aren't taken.

## Temperature Thresholds

ACI 306 defines cold weather concreting as any period when the average daily temperature falls below 40°F for three consecutive days. In the New York metro area, this typically spans from late November through early March.

## Protection and Curing

Freshly placed concrete must be protected from freezing for a minimum period after placement. This typically involves heated enclosures, insulated blankets, and careful monitoring of concrete temperature during the critical curing period.

## Mix Design Considerations

Winter concrete mixes often incorporate accelerating admixtures to speed strength gain. Your structural engineer should be involved in reviewing mix designs to ensure they meet the specified strength requirements within the project timeline.

Planning ahead is key. Contact your structural engineer during the design phase to discuss cold-weather placement requirements for your project.
